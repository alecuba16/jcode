# Repository Guidelines

## Development Workflow

- **Commit as you go** - Make small, focused commits after completing each feature or fix
- If the git state is not clean, or there are other agents working in the codebase in parallel, do your best to still commit your work. 
- **Push when done** - Push all commits to remote when finishing a task or session
- **Use fast iteration by default** - Prefer `cargo check`, targeted tests, and dev builds while iterating
- **Rebuild when done** - When you are done making changes, build the source.
- **Bump version for releases** - Update version in `Cargo.toml` when making releases. When cutting a new release, look at all the changes that happened since the last release and determine what the version bump should be ie patch or minor, etc. 
- **Remote builds available** - Use `scripts/remote_build.sh` to offload heavy cargo work to another machine. If your build is terminated, likely is because there are not enough resources on this machine to build. use remote build in that case. Try checking the resource avaliablity on the machine before you run a build. 

## Logs
- Logs are written to `~/.jcode/logs/` (daily files like `jcode-YYYY-MM-DD.log`).

## Debug Socket
- Use the debug socket for runtime level debugging
- **Use the user's Git identity** - Create commits with the configured
  `user.name` and `user.email`. Do not override them with `Jcode`, `Jcode agent`,
  or a fabricated agent email. Preserve existing contributor attribution when
  integrating work. If no identity is configured, ask rather than inventing one.
- **Welcome pull requests from everyone** - Review contributions on their merits,
  regardless of whether the author is a maintainer, an existing contributor, a
  first-time contributor, or an agent. Good PRs can be merged directly after review
  and validation. Do not require a maintainer-authored rewrite merely because of
  who submitted the change. See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for the contribution policy.
- **Keep work scoped** - Work on your own branch and preserve unrelated work. When
  the user asks you to review or integrate a PR or branch, you may inspect, test,
  and integrate that contribution regardless of author status. Do not pull in
  unrelated branches or merge a PR without user authorization.

## Install Notes
- `~/.local/bin/jcode` is the launcher symlink used from `PATH`.
- `~/.jcode/builds/current/jcode` is the active local/source-build channel; self-dev builds and `scripts/install_release.sh` point the launcher here.
- `~/.jcode/builds/stable/jcode` is the stable release channel; `scripts/install.sh` installs this and points the launcher here.
- `~/.jcode/builds/versions/<version>/jcode` stores immutable binaries.
- `~/.jcode/builds/canary/jcode` still exists for canary/testing flows, but it is not the primary self-dev install path.
- On Windows, the equivalents are `%LOCALAPPDATA%\\jcode\\bin\\jcode.exe` for the launcher, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\\jcode\\builds\\stable\\jcode.exe` for stable, and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\\jcode\\builds\\versions\\<version>\\jcode.exe` for immutable installs; `scripts/install.ps1` currently installs the stable channel.
- Ensure `~/.local/bin` is **before** `~/.cargo/bin` in `PATH`.

## Verifying a change at runtime

`cargo build` alone proves nothing about behavior. `jcode run` and interactive
sessions are served by the long-lived daemon at
`~/.jcode/builds/shared-server/jcode`, which is a symlink into
`~/.jcode/builds/versions/<version>/`. Until that symlink is repointed and the
daemon restarted (`jcode self-dev --build`), a freshly built binary is inert and
every runtime check silently measures the old code.

To test a change without disturbing the shared daemon or the caller's session,
run your build against its own socket:

```bash
cargo build --profile selfdev
./target/selfdev/jcode run --no-update --socket /run/user/1000/jcode-mytest.sock '<prompt>'
```

Two things that waste time otherwise:

- `crate::logging::info` writes to a log file, not stderr, so instrumenting a
  code path with it produces no visible output under `--trace`. Use `eprintln!`
  for throwaway diagnostics and delete it before committing.
- Confirm which binary you are actually inspecting. `strings` on
  `builds/shared-server/jcode` reads a 70-byte symlink, not a program; resolve it
  with `readlink -f` first.
